## SIGNIFICANT FEATURES OF REACT

- Component-Based Architecture: React uses a component-based architecture that allows developers to build modular and reusable code.

- Virtual DOM: React uses a virtual DOM (Document Object Model) to improve performance.

- Unidirectional Data Flow: React follows a unidirectional data flow architecture. Data flows in one direction, from parent to child components, making it easier to understand and debug code.

- JSX: JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows developers to write HTML-like code in their JavaScript files. JSX makes it easier to write and read code, as it combines HTML and JavaScript into one language.

- Server-Side Rendering: React allows developers to render the UI on the server-side, improving performance and SEO.

## ADVANTAGES OF REACT

1. **Component-based architecture:** React.js uses a component-based architecture that allows developers to create reusable components for the user interface. This makes it easier to maintain and scale applications.

2. **Fast Rendering:** React JS comprises of in-built functionality of virtual DOM, which makes the rendering faster and enhances the overall user experience. In addition, it makes the application lightweight, leading to boost performance and productivity.

3. **Flexibility**: Compared to other frontend frameworks, the React code is easier to maintain and is flexible due to its modular structure. This flexibility, in turn, saves a huge amount of time and cost to businesses.

4. **Performance**: React JS was designed to provide high performance in mind. The core of the framework offers a virtual DOM program and server-side rendering, which makes complex apps run extremely fast.

5. **Usability**: Deploying React is fairly easy to accomplish if you have some basic knowledge of JavaScript.

## What are the notable differences between HTML & JSX? Give at least 3 of them.

1. Syntax: HTML uses a tag-based syntax, where each element is enclosed in angle brackets (e.g., <div>, <p>, <img>). JSX, on the other hand, uses a syntax that looks similar to HTML but is actually a combination of JavaScript and XML. In JSX, elements are defined using a syntax that looks like HTML, but they are actually defined as JavaScript functions.
2. In HTML, multiple elements can be returned on the other hand,  Nested JSX must return one element, which we’ll call a parent element that wraps all other levels of nested elements. Without the wrapper element, JSX won’t transpile.

3. The class attribute can be used on any HTML element. The class name can be used by CSS and JavaScript to perform certain tasks for elements with the. However for JSX, You can’t use the word class to define HTML classes, since class is a reserved word in JavaScript, instead, use — className. 

## Why can’t browsers read JSX?
Browsers cannot directly read JSX because JSX is a syntax extension of JavaScript, and browsers can only interpret and execute JavaScript code. JSX needs to be compiled or transpiled into regular JavaScript code before it can be executed by the browser.

<!-- # Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
